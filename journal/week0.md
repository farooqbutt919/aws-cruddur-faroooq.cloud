### AWS CLI and Cloud Shell ###

I was able to install AWS CLI without any challenger. I also researched about how to use CLI for multiple users and came across --profile parameter. I created 2 IAM users(farooq and farooq2) and generated 2 set of credentials. I was able to switch AWS CLI credentials by using --profile parameter.

aws s3 ls --profile farooq <br>
aws s3 ls --profile farooq2
